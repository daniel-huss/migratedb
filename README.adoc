== Support

The main priority of this project is to provide a bloat-free library for database migrations.
Bugs will be fixed, and new software versions will be supported as long as the changes are testable.
New features must fit reasonably within the scope of a database schema migration _library_, and have to be useful to
a large number (>1) of users ðŸ˜‰

=== Build Prerequisites

- Java 11 or later.
- Maven 3 (preferably the latest version)
- Local or remote Docker/Podman host (for database containers during integration tests)

== Legacy

This project is a hard fork of Flyway 7.15. There is no affiliation whatsoever between this project and the owners of the Flyway trademark.
