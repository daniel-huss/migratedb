    <h1>Documentation: Dev Environment Setup</h1>

    <p>To contribute to the MigrateDB documentation site you will need to set up your development environment so that
        you run the
        website locally and submit changes. </p>

    <p>For this you will need to set up Git, Make, Docker and an editor.</p>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Editor</h3>

    <p>The documentation site uses HTML files with Liquid headers for Jekyll. We personally use IntelliJ, which works
        quite well,
        but feel free to use any editor that suits you.</p>

    <h2>Done!</h2>

    <p>Congratulations! You now have a fully functional dev environment for the MigrateDB documentation site. You can
        start
        contributing!</p>
