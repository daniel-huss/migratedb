    <h1>Code: Submit your Changes</h1>

    <p>Congratulations! You now have a fully functional dev environment for MigrateDB. You can start contributing!</p>

    <h2>Raise an issue</h2>

    <p>The first step is to raise an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/daniel-huss/migratedb/issues?state=open">Issue
        Tracker</a>. This issue will be the place where you will be able to communicate with MigrateDB's committers
        and other users. You can use it to present your ideas and gather feedback. </p>

    <h2>Fork the repository</h2>

    <p>The next step is to fork the <a href="https://github.com/daniel-huss/migratedb">GitHub repository</a>:</p>

    <h2>Write awesome code</h2>

    <p>Now is the time to work your magic and implement stuff! Commit your changes to your fork and don't forget to pull
        and merge the changes from the main repo as they happen.</p>

    <p>We use IntelliJ to develop MigrateDB. The <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/free_java_ide.html">free
        community edition</a> fits the bill perfectly. </p>

    <p>All source code is formatted using the default IntelliJ settings. </p>

    <h2>Publish your changes</h2>

    <p>Satisfied with your work? Great! Show the world! Create a <strong>pull request</strong> and briefly describe your
        changes.</p>

    <p>We'll have a look at them and provide you feedback until they're
        ready to be merged. If they are approved, we'll merge them in the mainline and include them in the next
        release!</p>

    <p><br/><br/><strong>Happy coding!</strong></p>
