# Maven Plugin

The MigrateDB Maven plugin exists to scan your class path during build time. To _execute_ MigrateDB commands during
build, you can use a generic scripting tool like the [GMavenPlus plugin](https://github.com/groovy/GMavenPlus). After
all, MigrateDB is just another library.

## Site

The full Maven plugin documentation is available at the [plugin documentation site](site).
